# project 2 - teddi
 

# Technologies Used
jquery - bootstrap
node.js
google fonts

# Approach Taken

#sprint1
began wireframing app
![alt text](https://github.com/philpatt/project2/blob/master/readme-img/NPS-wireframe.pdf)
create trello board
write index.js
stub out routes

create db
connect api to app
save api information to db
add more styling
deploy to github
deploy to heroku

# Issues
using bootstrap (should have implemented bootstrap layout earlier in development, this would have allowed me to approach mobile-first better)

Images from api were too large and took way too long to load


# Fun Stuff
Styling/finding pictures of teddi roosevelt 

# Unsolved Problems
Accessing more information from api (images)
not as mobile-friendly as I would hope. 
heroku deployment

# Next Steps
add another db to allow users to comment and tag each park
add about me page
